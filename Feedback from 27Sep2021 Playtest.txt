OBSERVATIONS

Speedplay -- the scoring system is working as intended
	Meaning speed leads to mistakes
2 is a prime number

Do I need some kind of penalty for being idle?
With expressions, hard to see since they're written in black (like the cursor)
	When highlighted by the player, can I change the color of them (possibly to the theme color)?

After an initial loss, it's kind of discouraging to go back to 1x combo...

Flavors don't change the color of anything


BRANDON'S FEEDBACK

good difficulty scale
get into a rhythm, satisfying
